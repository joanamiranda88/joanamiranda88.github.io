It was the year 2018 and Lisbon is considered the new creative capital of Europe. The challenge of this project was create a mobile application for tourists and locals to enjoy Lisbon in a better way. **Create a convergent experience for an emerging city**. The main goals are: connecting people (local and tourists) and get the locals to contribute to your city and be rewarded for it.
