The project consisted in a **redesign of a homepage and a page about the poet**, after training some user-centred methodologies like surveys. The purpose was to convey the multiplicity of Fernando Pessoa - what made him unique. The basic idea of ​​the new graphic image (4 heteronyms - 4 icons that repeat) is not transmitted on the website. The new website must convey it. It must convey the essence of Fernando Pessoa: his multiplicity.
