The challenge was **to develop a kitchen app**. A system that helps those who do not like to cook. Much people only cook from time to time, and this way knowledge about ingredients and recipes is reduced. When they cook the difficulty of discovering recipes and buying the products is enormous. This proposal should help you plan meals that can be produced with what is at hand. It is also the purpose of this interface to help keep the kitchen close, fun and useful.
