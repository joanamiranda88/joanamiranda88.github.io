# About me

For 7 years working in the field of communication design, focusing on print and editorial design, I decided to increase my range of knowledge and enroll in a Digital Experience Design course, convinced that I would only learn to make visual interfaces. **I ended up falling in love with UX**, because I realized that I could create something with more meaning that would make a difference in people's lives. I learned to fall in love with the problem and let the users and the business dictate the result, trying to focus on the *UX Design* area.
